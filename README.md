# 🎲 Monte Carlo Simulation  

This project is my small experiment with the **Monte Carlo method** – a cool mathematical technique that uses randomness to approximate results.  

I built this as part of practicing from Princeton’s *Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose* course. Instead of just finishing the assignment, I tried to make it look like a real project.

## 🚀 What does this project do?  
The idea is simple:  
- Imagine throwing darts randomly at a square.  
- By checking how many darts land inside the circle inscribed in the square, we can estimate the value of π (pi).  
- The more darts you throw, the closer you get to the real value of π.  

It’s like asking randomness to do math for us.
